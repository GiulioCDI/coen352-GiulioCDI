* A little about myself:


  Hello everyone, my name is Giulio Cesare, and I'm a 3rd-year electrical engineering student. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies; my favorite genres are horror and sci-fi. Beyond films, I enjoy playing the piano, weightlifting, video games, and reading research publications. I'm looking forward to the course and wish you all great success. 😀
