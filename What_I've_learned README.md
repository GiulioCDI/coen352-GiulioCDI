# What I've learned

Thanks to the readme.md I've learned how to use git and github. I've also learned how to create a repository, clone it to my local machine, make changes, commit those changes, and push them back to the remote repository on GitHub.
Addionally I've learned what branches are and how to create and manage them. I've also learned about pull requests and how they facilitate collaboration on projects.
